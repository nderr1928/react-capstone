    Objective:
        All plants are different aside from the fact that they need CO2, water, and sunshine to survive. 
        What affects the amount a plant needs is determined entirely by the climate. 
        Cacti need minimal water and can stand the heat, while aloe vera needs cooler temperatures and more water.
        This website will help you identify what plants will grow best in the climate that you are in and the time of year.
