Medicine App:
    Objective:
        Perscribed drugs are a very common form of health in modern times.
        There are so many types of drugs that have similar effects but different names, 
        and it can make it hard to keep track of what everything does.
        The purpose of this app will be to let non-logged viewers look up drug names to see their effects and side-effects.
        For logged users, they will be abe to do the above, but also save what drugs they are currently taking,
        make note of when they should take their next does, and give reminders on when to start going for a refill (5-7 days before out based on quantity and dose amount).

Flowers App:
    Objective:
        All plants are different aside from the fact that they need CO2, water, and sunshine to survive. 
        What affects the amount a plant needs is determined entirely by the climate. 
        Cacti need minimal water and can stand the heat, while aloe vera needs cooler temperatures and more water.
        This website will help you identify what plants will grow best in the climate that you are in and the time of year.
